* and more, comming soon...

## Here is how to make the script works

# Install

* Open The Terminal .
* Type the following commands :

```
    git clone https://github.com/callmezatiel/protocol
    cd protocol
    chmod +x protocol.sh
    sudo ./protocol.sh 
```

# NOTE: Run with a root privilege

PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Always run this in an authorized environment (lab or pentesting engagement).

You can add Masscan for large-scale scanning with speed.

Consider converting output to HTML reports using xsltproc or nmap-bootstrap.xsl for better visibility.

Add CLI flags (getopts) for non-interactive automation.
